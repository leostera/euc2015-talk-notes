* iO, and lisp

So the syntax tree can be as helpful given that it allows you to put as much
sugar as needed on top of the actual syntax.


Haskell wante dto be a lazy funciton alanguage with pure functions because the
academic space valued it more. It also has type inference that simplified
static typing with the Type class.

Keep clam and let it crash. <- Francesco and some other went to a plane with th
elet it crash t-shirt. Did'n t go well

Elm has a live web interpreter! Both erlang and elm belive acllbacks suck.

# Adapt or die

Languages have to be adaptable and be extensible. 

Simple, pure Idioms go into abstractions that we can fit into ideas that can be
extended to provide solutions.

Macros can be dangeours.

(+ 1 2)  and ('+ 1 2) is like having a kid run with scissors.

Elixir's abstractions are higher level, and thus help you reason about thinks.

Is an invetion that builds on another invention.

Pipe operator, defmacro, defprotocol.

Combining these elixir abstractions you can 

The Haskell Type class can be extended beautifully.

Check out Julia, Elm, Idris, Haskell.
